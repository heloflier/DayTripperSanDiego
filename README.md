# DayTripperSanDiego

An interactive, mobile-responsive solution for travelers. 

Upon receipt of a chosen area and an interest (with an option to further define such interest), it offers visitors a 5-day weather forecast along with a map of those locations, map markers and a list with details. If the visitors choose, they can log in/sign up: in this case they can save items from the list into their own account and retrieve the saved ones.

Technologies employed:

- AJAX calls to OpenWeather and Google Maps APIs
- Bootstrap mobile-responsive front end
- dynamic HTML generation with JQuery
- Firebase DB
- Simple sign-up authentication

Future improvements:

- cleaner, more streamlined front end
- expansion of Points of Interest categories
- (optional) code refactoring to split into more modules and clean up other contributors'
